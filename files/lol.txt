A rainy afternoon has its own kind of charm, with the steady sound of raindrops tapping against windows and rooftops. The gray sky, though overcast, brings a soothing atmosphere, inviting a sense of coziness indoors. As puddles form on the streets and leaves glisten with moisture, there's a quiet stillness in the air. People retreat to their homes, sipping warm drinks, reading books, or simply watching the rain fall. It's a time for introspection, where the world outside seems to slow down, and the comforting rhythm of the rain becomes a gentle backdrop to the day.
